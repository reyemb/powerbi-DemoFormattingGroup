# Demo for Using powerbi-visuals-utils-formattingmodel-community

## Overview

This repository demonstrates how to use the "powerbi-visuals-utils-formattingmodel-community" library for handling "formattinggroups". The community library serves as an alternative to Microsoft's official "powerbi-visuals-utils-formattingmodel", which lacks support for "formattinggroups".

## Prerequisites

- Node.js
- NPM
- Power BI Account

## Installation

Run the following command to install the required packages.

```
npm install powerbi-visuals-utils-formattingmodel-community
```

## Usage

### Settings.ts

Refer to the "src/settings.ts" file for how to properly configure "formattinggroups". 

### Sample Image

Check out the included image that shows the expected output with proper settings.

## Why Use The Community Version?

Microsoft's official "powerbi-visuals-utils-formattingmodel" does not support "formattinggroups". This community version addresses this limitation by enabling semantically logical grouping of your settings.
